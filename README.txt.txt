Discord Bot (Stump Bot)

This a personal project with the intent to be used in a guild server that would
provide the normal functionally of a all-in-one discord bot while having the
ability to access a game server API to pull data from the game that users request.

The major aspects of programming thats are in this projects are:
- Discord.js
- Node.js
- User input
- Multi-server data collection

This was my first stand alone project after finishing my program at NAIT. We had
not personally been introduced to Node.js and using outside libraries as most 
of our teachings were based upon the C# langauge and building our own methods and
libraries to use.
